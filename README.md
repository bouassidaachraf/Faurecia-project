# Faurecia-project

The aim of the project is to write a functional and structured code in python. This code should be able to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017/data of target TARGET_FLAG. This code should also explicitly return the value of the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric and generate a csv file with the predictions.

This project is composed of 4 parts: 

- data visualization. 
- Cleaning data.
- Modeling of different algorthimes in ML and Deep learning for binary classification. 
- Benchmark.



SVM is the best model for this project based on accurency.
